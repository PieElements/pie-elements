# text-entry 

A simple text input element.

Supports multiple languages, see the commented model in docs/demo/config.js

# configure package

Note that the configure package only exposes some of the functionality of the underlying model. This is because it's based on the old corespring ui. Some changes are coming to pie so that we'll be able to move this package out to a corespring specific repo and add a more polished ui for this package.

## TODO: 

* [ ] finalise schema
